rename App.hs -> Window.hs
* state
** which buttons are down
** which lights are on
** which buttons correspond to which voices
** which voices are playing what
* features
** light up enharmonics of pressed keys
(Sustained keys will come later.)

Some things to maybe track:
  The keys under your fingers
  Which pitch classes to light up
  Which keys are responsible for a lit pitch class

Window needs to keep track of which LEDs are on, off.
** add to ongoing sustained group
** transpose ongoing notes
** save to chord bank from sustain
** sustained voices do not block keys
** sustain these and future
This is what most piano sustain pedals do.
The sustain that's programmed so far sustains only things under your fingers when you press the sustain button.
** loop bank
** timbre
** split keyboard
** reset buttons
*** silence all voices
*** redraw entire grid
*** restore shift to 1
to remove floating point error
* separate projects
** separate Vivid.Jbb from Vivid
 this will make starting the repl faster
** separate my own Vivid projects
*** namely these
Vivid (clone, for reference)
Vivid.Synths.Jbb
Vivid.Dispatch
Monome
*** use symlinks between them as needed
e.g. from Monome to Synths
