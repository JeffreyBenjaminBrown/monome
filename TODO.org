* git branch structure
master -> ledRelay: done
master -> enharmonicLeds -> topLeftOrigin
  that is, before finishing enharmonicLeds, I'm taking a break to put the origin where it belongs
* features
** add to ongoing sustained group
** transpose ongoing notes
** save to chord bank from sustain
** sustained voices do not block keys

This is what most piano sustain pedals do.
** loop bank
** timbre
** split keyboard
** reset buttons
*** silence all voices
*** redraw entire grid
*** restore shift to 1
to remove floating point error
* separate projects
** separate Vivid.Jbb from Vivid
 this will make starting the repl faster
** separate my own Vivid projects
*** namely these
Vivid (clone, for reference)
Vivid.Synths.Jbb
Vivid.Dispatch
Monome
*** use symlinks between them as needed
e.g. from Monome to Synths
