* TODO rename Led -> LedState
* TODO Led and Switch should be synonyms for Bool
It would simplify, e.g., Window.Sustain.handle
* TODO resume at Window.Shift
* TODO redraw keyboard upon releasing sustain
=> make a function to draw the whole keyboard
* TODO dependentPitchClass should not exist
* TODO sustain: two buttons, "add these" and "release all"
"add these" stays in effect until it is released.
"release all" works as soon as it's touched; holding on it does nothing.
* TODO interrupting branch : fix the type of `voices` and `sustained`
voices should be dynamic
  if they are indexed instead by (X,Y), then the meaning of "sustained"
  becomes muddy
sustained should be a set of Pitches, not (X,Y)
* Montevideo - Monome Tidal Vivid
** Things to represent on the monome
synth param
rhythm
chord
melody
* TODO MAYBE
** sustain to middle of bottom, and duplicate at both top corners
 so that usually something can touch it
* features
** show sustained notes
** add to ongoing sustained group
** transpose ongoing notes
** save to chord bank from sustain
** sustained voices do not block keys
** sustain these and future
This is what most piano sustain pedals do.
** loop bank
** volume control for sustained notes
** timbre
** split keyboard
** reset buttons
*** silence all voices
*** redraw entire grid
*** restore shift to 1
to remove floating point error
* separate projects
** separate Vivid.Jbb from Vivid
 this will make starting the repl faster
** separate my own Vivid projects
*** namely these
Vivid (clone, for reference)
Vivid.Synths.Jbb
Vivid.Dispatch
Monome
*** use symlinks between them as needed
e.g. from Monome to Synths
