I want to connect to the monome using Haskell, by sending raw OSC over UDP -- because Haskell has no monome libraries (yet).

My first quesiton: My program should only communicate with the serialosc server, not directly with the device, correct?

My second question: Are the address "127.0.0.1") and the port "12002" all that should be required in order to find serialosc? I believe my Haskell code is creating the connection specified by that (address,port) pair, and then sending an OSC message with the address pattern  "/monome/grid/led/set" followed by the arguments 1, 1, and 15, in that order, all three formatted as integers. But I'm seeing no effect on the monome.

The code (all 10 lines of it) is [here](https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/monome/blob/master/src/Demo.hs).
