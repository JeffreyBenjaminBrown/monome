I want to connect to the monome using Haskell, by sending raw OSC over UDP (because Haskell has no monome libraries -- something I plan to change!).

My first quesiton: My program should only communicate with the serialosc server, correct?

My second question: Are the address "127.0.0.1") and the port "12002" all that should be required in order to find serialosc? I believe my Haskell code is creating the connection specified by that (address,port) pair, and then sending an OSC message with the address pattern  "/monome/grid/led/set" followed by the arguments 1, 1, and 15, in that order, all three formatted as integers. But I'm seeing no effect on the monome.
