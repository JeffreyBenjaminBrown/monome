OSC, UDP, SMH
---
I want to connect to the monome using Haskell, by sending raw OSC over UDP.

I can connect to the monome using Python, via the `pymonome` library -- but `pymonome` is too high-level for me to see how it's doing that.

To connect to a device over UDP, what do you need? Just the device's address in the filetree? Or maybe I shouldn't send directly to the monome at all, and should instead send to the serialosc server? That's my impression from looking at the [monome OSC protocol](https://monome.org/docs/osc/). If that's true, is serialosc running on a specific port? How can I know which one?

When I plug the monome in, a device called `ttyUSB0` shows up in my `/dev/` folder. Probably related, if I run `serialosc-detector`, I see the following print to the screen:

    ï¿½*V\P
         /dev/ttyUSB0\P

Maybe there is a UDP port number associated with the monome, too? If so, how can I find out which port number is associated with the monome?
