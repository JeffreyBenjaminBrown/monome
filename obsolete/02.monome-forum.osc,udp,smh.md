I want to connect to the monome using Haskell, by sending raw OSC over UDP -- because Haskell has no monome libraries (yet).

My first quesiton: My program should only communicate with the serialosc server, not directly with the device, correct?

My second question: Are the address "127.0.0.1") and the port "12002" all that should be required in order to find serialosc?

I believe my Haskell code is doing the following:

* Creating a connection specified by that (address,port) pair.
* Then sending an OSC message with the type tag string  "/monome/grid/led/set" followed by the arguments 1, 1, and 15, in that order. (With all three numbers are formatted as integers.)

I'm seeing no effect on the monome. By contrast, the first program in the [monomne Python tutorial](https://monome.org/docs/grid-studies/python/) works perfectly.

The code (all 10 lines of it) is [here](https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/monome/blob/master/src/Demo.hs).
